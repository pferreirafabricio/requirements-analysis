# ðŸ’Ž Requirements Analysis

Focus on the tasks that determine the needs the requirements for new projects or products, using the opinion of various [stakeholders](#stakeholders).

Principals of good requirements:

- Documented
- Actionable
- Measurable
- Testable
- Traceable
- Related to business needs
- Sufficient details for system design

The analysis usually includes three types of activities:

**Eliciting documents:** Business process documentation and stakeholder interviews.

**Recording requirements:** Documenting in various forms (natural-language documents, use cases, user stories).

**Analyzing requirements:** Analyze that the requirements are clear, complete, unduplicated, concise, valid, consistent, etc.

It's important to identify all the stakeholders, take into account all their needs, and make sure that they understand the changes in a new system.

To elicit the requirements there are some tools: the development of scenarios (user stories), the identification of use cases, interviews, workshops, and others.

## Core concepts

### Stakeholders

A people or organization that have a valid interest in the system, but not limited to the organization that employs the analyst. Other stakeholders could be:

- anyone who operates the system (normal and maintenance operators)
- anyone who benefits from the system (functional, political, financial, and social beneficiaries)
- anyone involved in purchasing or procuring the system
- organizations that regulate aspects of the system (financial, safety, and other regulators)
- people or organizations opposed to the system (negative stakeholders)
- organizations responsible for systems that interface with the system under design
- those organizations that integrate horizontally with the organization for whom the analyst is designing the system

### Prototypes

A computer program that exhibits a part of the properties of another computer program, aims to help future users and stakeholders to get an idea of what the system will look like. It can be delivered as mockups, wireframes, and others.

### Use cases

A structure for documenting the functional requirements and the behavior of a system. It provides a set of scenarios that specify how the system should interact with a human user or another system.

### Requirements

It is the specification of what is required to meet the business needs within the solution scope. The main goal is to move the understanding of the system from a current as-is state to a future-to-be state.

#### Specifications

- Which questions to ask yourself when doing requirements analysis?

#### Business requirements

High-level definitions, without much details or reference, about business-level goals aiming for an outcome.

#### Customer requirements

The expectations of the customer about the system. These requirements answer the following questions:

> - Operational distribution or deployment: Where will the system be used?
> - Mission profile or scenario: How will the system accomplish its mission objective?
> - Performance and related parameters: What are the critical system parameters to accomplish the mission?
> - Utilization environments: How are the various system components to be used?
> - Effectiveness requirements: How effective or efficient must the system be in performing its mission?
> - Operational life cycle: How long will the system be in use by the user?
> - Environment: What environments will the system be expected to operate effectively?

#### Architectural requirements

Specifies what has to be done in a conceptual model that defines the structure and behavior of a system.

#### Functional requirements

The specific behavior or task, action, or activity that needs to be accomplished.

#### Non-functional requirements

Complementary requirements that can be used to judge the operation of a system, like performance, usability, security, etc.

### Business Rules

A business rule defines or constrains some aspect of a business, it describes the operations, definitions, and constraints that can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization.
